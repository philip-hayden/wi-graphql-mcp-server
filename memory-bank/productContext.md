# Wildlife Insights MCP Server - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Wildlife management and conservation efforts generate vast amounts of camera trap data, but analyzing this data requires technical GraphQL API knowledge and complex query construction. Researchers, ranch managers, and conservationists need an intuitive way to access and analyze wildlife data without becoming GraphQL experts.

### The Solution
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides natural language tools for accessing Wildlife Insights data, enabling users to navigate data hierarchies, process species identifications, and generate management insights through simple, intuitive commands.

## Problems This Solves

### 1. Technical Barrier to Entry
**Before**: Users need to understand GraphQL, authentication, and complex query structures
**After**: Simple commands like "show me my organizations" or "how many images need identification"

### 2. Identification Workflow Inefficiency
**Before**: Manual processing of hundreds/thousands of camera trap images
**After**: Streamlined identification workflow with progress tracking and bulk operations

### 3. Data-Driven Management Gap
**Before**: Limited ability to generate actionable insights from wildlife data
**After**: AI-powered recommendations for habitat management, species conservation, and ranch operations

### 4. Texas Ranch Management Challenges
**Before**: Scattered data across multiple platforms, difficult to correlate with management goals
**After**: Unified wildlife data platform tailored for Texas ranch management objectives

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow

```
User launches AI assistant → MCP server connects → Natural language queries → Structured wildlife insights
```

### Example Interactions

#### New User Onboarding
```
User: "Show me my organizations"
Assistant: "You have access to 1 organization: TrailSense (you're the owner)"
```

#### Identification Workflow
```
User: "How many images need identification?"
Assistant: "Found 268 images needing identification in project Initial_Run"

User: "Get images for identification"
Assistant: "Retrieved 20 images with thumbnails and deployment info"
```

#### Management Planning
```
User: "Give me ranch management insights"
Assistant: "Based on your data: 7 species detected, focus on white-tailed deer management, consider habitat enhancement"
```

## User Experience Goals

### 1. Intuitive Discovery
- Users can explore their data without knowing the underlying structure
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Context-aware suggestions and guidance

### 2. Efficient Workflows
- Batch operations for repetitive tasks
- Progress tracking and status updates
- Error recovery and helpful messaging

### 3. Actionable Insights
- Texas-specific management recommendations
- Species and habitat analysis
- Temporal and spatial pattern recognition

### 4. Flexible Integration
- Works with existing Wildlife Insights accounts
- Supports various management goals (conservation, hunting, ecotourism)
- Scales from small ranches to large conservation areas

## Target User Personas

### 1. Ranch Manager (Primary)
- **Philip Hayden** - Texas ranch owner
- **Goals**: Balance conservation, hunting, and land management
- **Needs**: Species monitoring, habitat management recommendations
- **Pain Points**: Too much data, not enough insights

### 2. Wildlife Biologist
- **Goals**: Research and conservation
- **Needs**: Species identification, population analysis
- **Pain Points**: Time-consuming data processing

### 3. Conservation Organization
- **Goals**: Biodiversity monitoring, habitat protection
- **Needs**: Multi-site analysis, trend identification
- **Pain Points**: Complex data aggregation

### 4. Ecotourism Operator
- **Goals**: Wildlife experiences, visitor education
- **Needs**: Species information, activity patterns
- **Pain Points**: Dynamic content creation
