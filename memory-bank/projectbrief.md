# Wildlife Insights MCP Server - Project Brief

## Core Requirements

Build a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides natural language access to the Wildlife Insights GraphQL API for wildlife management and conservation efforts.

## Project Scope

### Primary Goal
Create an intelligent interface between AI assistants and the Wildlife Insights platform to enable seamless wildlife data analysis, species identification workflows, and habitat management insights.

### Target Users
- Wildlife researchers and biologists
- Conservation organizations
- Ranch managers and landowners
- Ecotourism operators
- Students and educators in wildlife management

### Geographic Focus
- Texas ranch wildlife management (primary use case)
- General wildlife conservation (secondary)
- Global biodiversity monitoring (tertiary)

## Core Functionality

### 1. Data Hierarchy Navigation
- Navigate organizational structure naturally
- Explore projects, deployments, and data files
- Understand spatial and temporal data relationships

### 2. Species Identification Workflow
- Process images requiring identification
- Submit species identifications with metadata
- Track identification progress and quality
- Handle bulk identification operations

### 3. Analytics and Insights
- Generate wildlife management recommendations
- Analyze species patterns and trends
- Provide habitat management guidance
- Create deployment optimization strategies

### 4. Texas-Specific Features
- Texas game species classification
- Ranch management goal alignment (conservation/hunting/ecotourism)
- Local habitat and seasonal considerations
